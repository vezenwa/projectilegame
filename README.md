Projectile Game Program: Information that isn’t obvious in the program
 A round continues until the user hits the target (guesses the right velocity and angle to get within 3m of the required range) or quits. If the user does not hit the target, he will be asked if he wants to guess again. If the user says ‘Yes’, he will be allowed to guess new input values for the same target range as before. This time, he will be able to make better guesses because the program outputs the range each guess produces. If the user says ‘No’ to guessing again, he will be asked if he wants to quit the game. At this point, If the user says ‘No’, he will be provided with another target range for a new round. If the user says ‘Yes’ to quitting, the game ends. If the user hits the target, he will also be asked if he wants to quit the game (or go for a new round).
